<div style="font-size:1.2em;color:#999;">

<p>Hello world. The purpose of this document is to share an understanding of my personality, my ways of working, and my decision making strategies.</p>

<p>I am self-driven, passionate, and both willing and capable to branch into new disciplines to provide the most value to my team. Those traits have yielded a <a href="https://jchyip.medium.com/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437" target="_blank">T-shaped</a> engineer with a breadth of experiences creating alignment across roles in an R&D organization, while at the same time a depth of experiences as an individual contributor.</p>

## Who I Am

I am first and foremost a **software architect** passionate about finding ways to efficiently write higher quality software.

Through that passion I have become an experienced **product engineer** with an understanding that the lines between product and engineering are often blurred, and alignment between product and technical strategies are a key component of success. 

The ultimate measurement of team success is through delivery, and as an **agile developer** I coach teams across disciplines in frameworks and methodologies that systematize and simplify the process to frequently deliver high quality work.

I am first and foremost a **software architect** passionate about finding ways to efficiently write higher quality software. 


> "Good architecture makes the system easy to understand, easy to develop, easy to maintain, and easy to deploy. The ultimate goal is to minimize the lifetime cost of the system and to maximize programmer productivity." - Bob Martin, Clean Architecture


Good architecture means you can do more with less. Your systems are resilient to change over time, which means fewer people are needed to evolve the system and deliver features, contributing to a [LEAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development) team. Your systems are easily understood by stakeholders beyond just the engineering team, which is key to [domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).

#### Design Patterns

I’m a big proponent of [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), among [others](https://josephspens.nyc/links/#learning-architectural-design-patterns), which I’ve found applicable in most software disciplines. A key pillar to these architectures is _layered software_, finding ways to organize and categorize software by its purpose to simplify the mental model.

Most challenges and software design tactics are not original, common [software design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) are critical in keeping the mental model simple. Applying more patterns to software might increase its source code footprint, but will also reduce overall complexity and facilitate understanding across stakeholder disciplines.

A better understanding of your software through good architecture and DDD contributes to a better understanding of the impact of changes, which means simple, accurate, and confident project planning estimates.

  <summary><h3>Product Engineer</h3></summary>

Through that passion for software architecture I have become an experienced **product engineer** with an understanding that the lines between product and engineering are often blurred, and alignment between product and technical strategies are a key component of success.


#### Goal Setting

My mental model for product direction best aligns with [OKRs](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example). I’ve found  to be a great model for understanding this method.

Providing some **vision** and **mission** for an organization, recursively unpacking the mission and each subsequent **objective**/goal into measurable **key results** is a great way to codify priorities. Broader organizational objectives highlight how your work contributes to higher level goals, and where to invest/divest resources.


#### Strategy

Those initial objectives paint the target, and the product **strategy** helps you choose key results and derivative objectives. I like the [Good Strategy, Bad Strategy](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/11721966) concept of a strategy “kernel”, which includes a diagnosis of current challenges and opportunities, guiding principles for decision making, and a set of initial coherent actions that get you going in the right direction.


#### Roadmaps

Roadmaps describe sequences of changes that make some measurable impact to key results. Those changes are to create new **user journeys** through the system, which add up to some measurable impact in support of customer **use cases**.

I like using [gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) to describe those user journeys. Given some state of the world, when a customer performs an action, they expect some subsequent result. An effective way to identify user journeys is through the DDD exercise of [event storming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_storming), which begins by asking customers what their goals are and how they go about accomplishing them, then drills into domain details.

  <summary><h3>Agile Developer</h3></summary>

The ultimate measurement of team success is through delivery, and as an **agile developer** I coach teams across disciplines in frameworks and methodologies that systematize and simplify the process to frequently deliver high quality work.

Technical ownership is being accountable for the delivery of software. This means contributing to and understanding the product goals, articulating the changes needed to achieve those goals, and accurately projecting delivery of these changes.


#### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

I’ve found [domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) to be the most effective framework for both establishing a shared understanding of a system’s purpose and evolving that shared understanding to accommodate changes needed to reach its goals. Any size organization, from small pizza-size squads to tech giant sized companies, can benefit from DDD. Regular retrospectives are often a good time to do some knowledge crunching and contribute individual discoveries to the team’s shared domain model.


#### Scrum

A structured set of  go a long way to minimizing administrative work and focusing on your core discipline. It’s also an effective means to producing and managing an extensive backlog of tasks.

## How I Communicate

Asynchronous forms of communication are best for me. It allows me to minimize context switching, prioritize my focus, and consider a response rather than provide a reaction.

* **Chat** - Slack (or an equivalent chat system) is my primary communication tool. I like to take advantage of channel organization and threads to organize thoughts and conversation. It’s an easy place to store relevant links and documents.
* **Wikis** - Chat can be ephemeral so intranets and internal wikis are a great place to create a repository of knowledge.
* **Requests for Comment** - Often I like structuring or diagraming my thoughts in documents to be shared (this document being a good case in point). It’s a way for me to illustrate my mental model of a concept to align with others and receive feedback from their mental models, hopefully aligning around something that works for everyone.

My approach to communicating is through **active listening**, where I listen to what you say, process it through my mental model, and repeat back what I understood. There are a number of opportunities for misinterpretation, so my goal is for you to verify my interpretation of what you just said, otherwise correct and evolve my mental model..


## Things That Energize Me

* Delivery **momentum**: shipping features feels great, closing tickets feels great, ideally it happens daily
* Building **consensus** on the team, for any topic, but especially on frameworks for measuring success and plan work
* Understanding the **alignment** between our near term roadmap and our long term mission
* Mid day **walks** around my neighborhood with my dog


## Fun Personal Facts

* I’m an open water certified scuba diver
* Both my family and my wife’s family, by coincidence, hail from the same region of Italy
* Dog dad to a 2 year old Australian Shepherd puppy
